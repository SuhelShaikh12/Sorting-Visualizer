# 🎨 Sorting Visualizer

🌐 **Live Demo** → [Check it out](https://SuhelShaikh12.github.io/Sorting-Visualizer/)

Sorting algorithms are core to computer science and data structures. This project visually demonstrates how various sorting algorithms work in an interactive and engaging way — perfect for both beginners and enthusiasts!

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🎞️ Real-time visualization of popular sorting algorithms  
- 🧠 Intuitive understanding of sorting logic through animations  
- 🛠️ Simple and clean UI for focused learning  
- 🔄 Adjustable array size and speed (if implemented)  

---

## ✨ Supported Algorithms

### 🔹 Quick Sort
- Efficient divide-and-conquer approach  
- Average-case time complexity: **O(n log n)**  
- See how pivot-based partitioning works in real time  

### 🔹 Merge Sort
- Stable and recursive sorting technique  
- Time complexity: **O(n log n)**  
- Watch arrays split and merge step-by-step  

### 🔹 Bubble Sort
- Simple and educational for beginners  
- Time complexity: **O(n²)**  
- Observe adjacent elements "bubble" into place  

### 🔹 Selection Sort
- Easy to understand and implement  
- Time complexity: **O(n²)**  
- Repeatedly selects the smallest element and moves it to the correct position
